# Microeconomics Topic Guide

Reference for common microeconomics lecture topics with key concepts, formulas, and daily-life examples.

## 1. Supply and Demand / Arz ve Talep

**Key Concepts:**
- Law of demand (inverse P-Q relationship)
- Law of supply (positive P-Q relationship)
- Market equilibrium
- Shifts vs. movements along curves

**Core Formulas:**

Demand function:
$$
Q_d = a - bP
$$

Supply function:
$$
Q_s = c + dP
$$

Equilibrium condition:
$$
Q_d = Q_s \implies P^* = \frac{a-c}{b+d}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Uber surge pricing during rain
- Concert ticket prices and resale markets
- Seasonal fruit prices (strawberries in winter vs summer)
- Housing prices in university towns during semester

**Common Misconceptions:**
- Confusing shift of curve vs movement along curve
- Thinking higher price always means higher profit

## 2. Elasticity / Esneklik

**Key Concepts:**
- Price elasticity of demand
- Income elasticity (normal vs inferior goods)
- Cross-price elasticity (substitutes vs complements)
- Elastic vs inelastic demand

**Core Formulas:**

Price elasticity of demand:
$$
\epsilon_d = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{dQ}{dP} \cdot \frac{P}{Q}
$$

Total revenue and elasticity:
$$
\begin{aligned}
|\epsilon_d| > 1 &\implies \text{elastic} \implies P \downarrow \text{ increases } TR \\
|\epsilon_d| < 1 &\implies \text{inelastic} \implies P \uparrow \text{ increases } TR
\end{aligned}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Insulin (perfectly inelastic) vs luxury watches (elastic)
- Netflix subscription vs movie theater tickets
- Gasoline in short-run vs long-run
- Salt vs restaurant meals

## 3. Consumer Theory / Tüketici Teorisi

**Key Concepts:**
- Utility maximization
- Budget constraint
- Indifference curves and MRS
- Income and substitution effects

**Core Formulas:**

Budget constraint:
$$
P_x \cdot x + P_y \cdot y = M
$$

Utility maximization condition (MRS = price ratio):
$$
MRS_{xy} = \frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = \frac{P_x}{P_y}
$$

Lagrangian setup:
$$
\mathcal{L} = U(x,y) + \lambda(M - P_x x - P_y y)
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Choosing between Spotify and Netflix with limited budget
- Buying generic vs brand-name products
- Time allocation: study vs leisure
- Coffee shop choices: size and add-ons

## 4. Production and Costs / Üretim ve Maliyetler

**Key Concepts:**
- Production function
- Short-run vs long-run
- Diminishing marginal returns
- Economies of scale

**Core Formulas:**

Production function:
$$
Q = f(K, L)
$$

Cobb-Douglas example:
$$
Q = A \cdot K^\alpha \cdot L^\beta
$$

Cost relationships:
$$
\begin{aligned}
TC &= FC + VC \\
AC &= \frac{TC}{Q} = AFC + AVC \\
MC &= \frac{dTC}{dQ}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why small cafes can't compete with Starbucks on price
- Amazon's warehouse efficiency
- Why food trucks have lower costs than restaurants
- Hiring interns: diminishing returns

## 5. Market Structures / Piyasa Yapıları

**Key Concepts:**
- Perfect competition
- Monopoly
- Oligopoly
- Monopolistic competition

**Core Formulas:**

Profit maximization (all markets):
$$
MR = MC
$$

Perfect competition ($P = MR$):
$$
P = MC
$$

Monopoly pricing:
$$
MR = P\left(1 + \frac{1}{\epsilon_d}\right) = MC
$$

Lerner Index:
$$
L = \frac{P - MC}{P} = -\frac{1}{\epsilon_d}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Perfect competition: agricultural markets, foreign exchange
- Monopoly: local utilities, patented drugs
- Oligopoly: mobile carriers, airlines, streaming services
- Monopolistic competition: restaurants, clothing brands

## 6. Game Theory / Oyun Teorisi

**Key Concepts:**
- Nash equilibrium
- Dominant strategies
- Prisoner's dilemma
- Sequential games

**Core Setup:**

Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix:
| | Cooperate | Defect |
|---|---|---|
| **Cooperate** | (3,3) | (0,5) |
| **Defect** | (5,0) | (1,1) |

Nash equilibrium: Both defect → (1,1)

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Group project free-riding
- Price wars between Pepsi and Coca-Cola
- OPEC oil production decisions
- Social media platform competition
