# Macroeconomics Topic Guide

Reference for common macroeconomics lecture topics with key concepts, formulas, and daily-life examples.

## 1. GDP and National Income / GSYİH ve Milli Gelir

**Key Concepts:**
- GDP vs GNP
- Nominal vs Real GDP
- GDP components (C, I, G, NX)
- GDP per capita and living standards

**Core Formulas:**

Expenditure approach:
$$
Y = C + I + G + (X - M)
$$

Real GDP:
$$
\textrm{Real GDP} = \frac{\textrm{Nominal GDP}}{\textrm{GDP Deflator}} \times 100
$$

GDP growth rate:
$$
g = \frac{Y_t - Y_{t-1}}{Y_{t-1}} \times 100
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why GDP rose but you don't feel richer (per capita matters)
- Turkey's GDP vs Luxembourg's GDP per capita
- COVID-19 impact on GDP components
- Informal economy and GDP measurement

## 2. Inflation / Enflasyon

**Key Concepts:**
- CPI and inflation measurement
- Demand-pull vs cost-push inflation
- Inflation expectations
- Real vs nominal values

**Core Formulas:**

Inflation rate:
$$
\pi = \frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-1}}{CPI_{t-1}} \times 100
$$

Fisher equation:
$$
i = r + \pi^e
$$

Real interest rate:
$$
r = i - \pi
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Grocery prices over the past year
- Why your grandparents talk about cheap prices "back in the day"
- Salary negotiations and inflation expectations
- Housing prices vs general inflation

## 3. Unemployment / İşsizlik

**Key Concepts:**
- Types: frictional, structural, cyclical
- Natural rate of unemployment
- Labor force participation
- Phillips curve relationship

**Core Formulas:**

Unemployment rate:
$$
u = \frac{\textrm{Unemployed}}{\textrm{Labor Force}} \times 100
$$

Labor force participation rate:
$$
LFPR = \frac{\textrm{Labor Force}}{\textrm{Working Age Population}} \times 100
$$

Okun's Law (approximate):
$$
\Delta u \approx -0.5 \times (g_Y - 3\%)
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- New graduates searching for jobs (frictional)
- Coal miners in a green energy transition (structural)
- Layoffs during recession (cyclical)
- Gig economy and unemployment statistics

## 4. Money and Banking / Para ve Bankacılık

**Key Concepts:**
- Functions of money
- Money supply (M1, M2)
- Money creation and multiplier
- Central bank tools

**Core Formulas:**

Money multiplier:
$$
m = \frac{1}{rr}
$$

where $rr$ = reserve ratio

Money supply expansion:
$$
\Delta M_s = m \times \Delta \textrm{Reserves}
$$

Quantity theory of money:
$$
M \times V = P \times Y
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why banks can't lend all deposits
- What happens when you deposit ₺1000
- Why central bank interest rate affects your mortgage
- Cryptocurrency vs traditional money

## 5. Fiscal Policy / Maliye Politikası

**Key Concepts:**
- Government spending and taxes
- Budget deficit/surplus
- Automatic stabilizers
- Crowding out effect

**Core Formulas:**

Government budget:
$$
\textrm{Budget Balance} = T - G - Tr
$$

Spending multiplier:
$$
k_G = \frac{1}{1 - MPC}
$$

Tax multiplier:
$$
k_T = -\frac{MPC}{1 - MPC}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Stimulus checks during COVID-19
- Infrastructure spending and job creation
- Progressive taxation and inequality
- Student loan policies

## 6. Monetary Policy / Para Politikası

**Key Concepts:**
- Central bank independence
- Policy rate and transmission mechanism
- Inflation targeting
- Quantitative easing

**Core Formulas:**

Taylor Rule (simplified):
$$
i = r^* + \pi + 0.5(\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5(Y - Y^*)
$$

where:
- $r^*$ = natural real rate
- $\pi^*$ = target inflation
- $Y^*$ = potential output

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why TCMB rate decisions affect your credit card interest
- How rate hikes cool housing market
- Why low rates encourage borrowing
- Mortgage rates and home buying decisions

---

## 7. International Trade / Uluslararası Ticaret

**Key Concepts:**
- Comparative advantage
- Terms of trade
- Trade balance
- Exchange rate regimes

**Core Formulas:**

Comparative advantage condition:
$$
\frac{a_{LC}}{a_{LW}} < \frac{a^*_{LC}}{a^*_{LW}}
$$

Real exchange rate:
$$
q = e \times \frac{P^*}{P}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why Turkey exports textiles, imports technology
- iPhone assembly in China vs design in USA
- Tourism and exchange rate fluctuations
- Imported car prices and lira depreciation

---

## 8. Economic Growth / Ekonomik Büyüme

**Key Concepts:**
- Solow growth model
- Convergence hypothesis
- Human capital
- Total factor productivity

**Core Formulas:**

Solow production function:
$$
Y = A \cdot K^\alpha \cdot L^{1-\alpha}
$$

Per capita form:
$$
y = A \cdot k^\alpha
$$

Steady state capital:
$$
k^* = \left(\frac{s \cdot A}{n + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}
$$

**Daily-Life Examples:**
- Why South Korea grew faster than Argentina
- Education investment and future earnings
- Technology adoption and productivity
- Population aging and growth challenges
